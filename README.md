# üéØ What I Aimed For.
The project aims to build and train a machine learning model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations. This will take into account various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.

This project is a checkpoint for the '5G-Energy consumption' dataset provided by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2023 as part of a global challenge for data scientists.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Instructions.
- Data Handling:
  1. Import Data and Perform Basic Exploration:
      Import the dataset and explore its basic structure and statistics.

  2. Display General Information:
      Display basic information and summary statistics about the dataset.

  3. Create a Pandas Profiling Report:
      Generate a pandas profiling report to gain insights into the dataset.

  4. Handle Missing and Corrupted Values:
      Address any missing or corrupted values in the dataset.

  5. Remove Duplicates:
      Remove any duplicate records if they exist.

  6. Handle Outliers:
      Detect and handle any outliers in the dataset.

  7. Encode Categorical Features:
      Encode categorical features to prepare them for machine learning algorithms.

  8. Select Target Variable and Features:
      Select the target variable (Energy) and the feature set.

  9. Split Dataset:
      Split the dataset into training and test sets.

- Model Building and Evaluation:
  1. Select ML Regression Algorithm:
      Based on the data exploration phase, select a suitable ML regression algorithm.

  2. Train the Model:
      Train the model on the training set.

  3. Assess Model Performance:
      Evaluate the model performance on the test set using relevant evaluation metrics.
